# code-quiz

## Description 

In this project, I worked on a multiple-choice code quiz. When the user clicks start, the multiple choices will pop up and time will start. When you answer it correctly, the button will be green, and when you answer it incorrectly, the button will be red and time will be reduced by 10 sec. Finally, you can save your old and new scores and view them anytime.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
